# FinOne - Personal Finance Manager

A minimal, offline-first PWA for managing multiple financial accounts in one place.

## Why FinOne?

Managing accounts across different banks, wallets, and exchanges is tedious. You have to:

- Open multiple apps to check balances
- Remember which account has what currency
- Track changes manually

FinOne solves this with a single dashboard where you manually update balances weekly and see everything at a glance.
